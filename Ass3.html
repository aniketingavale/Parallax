            The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for cricket in India and is under the jurisdiction of Ministry 
            of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India. The board was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu 
            Societies Registration Act. It is a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who 
            in turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Grant Govan was its first president and Anthony De Mello 
            its first secretary.

                Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest 
                cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision 
                in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - 
                the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots 
                (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.

                Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an Indian captain in ODIs and T20Is, and most 
                back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team 
                to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the 
                final of the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies 
                (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series
                 wins in New Zealand and the West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also led the 
                Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings.

                An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to 
                kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be 
                more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the 
                contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely 
                credited for changing the fitness culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. 
                Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also 
                happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian 
                cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which 
                they did plenty under him.
